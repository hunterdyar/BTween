This is my personal tweening library I created as an open alternative to DoTween. It values extensibility, but not performance or memory overhead. It's not very robust, I add features as I need them.

However, if you're looking for something performant, free to use, and open-source; check out [primetween](https://github.com/KyryloKuzyk/PrimeTween).
